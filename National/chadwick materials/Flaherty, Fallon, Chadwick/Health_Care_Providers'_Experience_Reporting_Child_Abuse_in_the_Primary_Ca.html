</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="12"></a><p class="fulltext-ABSTRACT fulltext-INDENT">Design and Methods: Health care providers (76 physicians, 8 nurse practitioners, and 1 physician assistant) in a regional practice-based network completed written surveys that collected information about the demographic characteristics of each provider and practice; the provider's career experience with child abuse; and the provider's previous year's experience identifying and reporting suspected child abuse, including experience with CPS.</p>

In the preceding 1 year, 48 respondents (56%) indicated that they had treated a child they suspected was abused, for an estimated total of 152 abused children. Seven (8%) of 85 providers did not report a total of 7 children with suspected abuse (5% of all suspected cases). A majority of providers (63%; n=29) believed that children who were reported had not benefited from CPS intervention, and 21 (49%) indicated that their experience with CPS made them less willing to report future cases of suspected abuse. Providers who had some formal education in child abuse after residency were 10 times more likely to report all abuse than were providers who had none.</p>

Past negative experience with CPS and perceived lack of benefit to the child were common reasons given by providers for not reporting. Education increases the probability that providers will report suspected abuse.</p>

In 1990 in Illinois, 103,000 children were reported as abused or neglected to child protective services (CPS). Although medical personnel reported 18% of children, only 4% of the total reports came from office-based physicians. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#69">1</a> Only 1% of all reports to the Ohio Central Registry for Child Abuse in 1981 were from private physicians' offices. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#70">2</a> Three explanations for the paucity of reports from office-based physicians are (1) low rate of presentation of abused children to primary care settings, (2) nonrecognition of abused children who present to primary care settings, and (3) nonreporting of recognized cases.</p>

A 1983 survey of physicians in Virginia reported that they saw few cases of abuse or neglect in their offices; 26% had encountered no abuse or neglect in the previous year. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#71">3</a> In 1990, an American Academy of Pediatrics survey <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#72">4</a> found that 45% of primary care pediatricians had treated or consulted on patients who were victims of child abuse during the previous 8 weeks. These pediatricians reported treating an average of 2.8 patients who were victims of physical abuse during this period. A 1998 American Academy of Pediatrics survey <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#73">5</a> found that 57% of 608 pediatricians reported that they had treated injuries from child abuse in the previous year.</p>

This statute does not allow the disclosure of information collected other than for the purpose for which it was supplied. This assurance was important because state child abuse reporting laws provide for disciplinary action and legal consequences if a health care provider willfully fails to report child abuse.

One practitioner wrote, "I felt threatened by the mother that she would abduct or harm my child." Individual practitioners reported that other patients had heard about the report and left the practice, the family was disrupted without benefit to the child, and the provider had spent a lot of time on the telephone related to the suspected child abuse case. None of the participants had been sued for malpractice as a result of reporting suspected abuse, but one was threatened with a lawsuit and one was reported to the state licensing board.

Four providers did not report 31 children, but listed as a reason that the child had already been reported or that the child was referred to a child abuse team.

</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="53"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Seven providers (8%) in our survey said they had not reported a child who they suspected was maltreated; these results are comparable to those of the study by Saulsbury and Campbell. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#71">3</a> Uncertainty as to whether a child was abused was the most common reason children were not reported. Providers listed this reason for not reporting in 2 previous physician surveys. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#71">3, 7</a></p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="54"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Although state statutes require that health care providers report all suspected abuse, some providers might at times be reluctant to report unless they possess the same degree of diagnostic certainty they have when treating other medical problems. We speculate that providers wish to spare children and families from unnecessary distress and need to make a more definitive diagnosis before reporting.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="55"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Although only one third of the participants said that they had been informed by CPS of the progress and disposition of the reported case, nearly two thirds believed that CPS intervention had not benefited the child. This study did not address the basis on which this conclusion was reached, but clearly providers need CPS feedback.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="56"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">In deciding whether to report a case of suspected child abuse, our respondents indicated that they consider (1) the probability of the abuse, (2) the likely effect of CPS intervention if the child was not abused, (3) the likely effect of CPS intervention if the child was abused, and (4) the consequences for the provider. Although the first factor is most important, our findings suggest that the other 3 factors contribute to not reporting abuse based on previous career experience.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="57"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">This study suggests 3 changes that would better enhance primary care provider reporting of suspected abuse. Past efforts at improving child abuse reporting have focused on improving providers' identification of abuse. Results of our study show that education makes a difference in reporting. It is not clear whether education increases identification or increases the provider's comfort level with the reporting process. Efforts must be made to ensure that all primary care providers receive continuing medical education about child abuse. Several states have mandated that all professionals who are legally required to report suspected child abuse must receive education about child abuse as a prerequisite to licensing. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#77">9-10</a></p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="58"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Second, the results of this study demonstrate that improving the outcome for children who have suspected abuse injuries is important for medical care provider reporting compliance. Health care providers must be convinced that their intervention will help the child and the family. Just more than one third of our sample believed that CPS intervention helped the child. McDonald and Reece <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#79">11</a> postulated that one barrier to physician reporting is the practitioner's belief that reporting child abuse accomplishes little for the child. After conducting an extensive literature review on variables that affect the identification and reporting of abuse, Warner and Hansen <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#80">12</a> speculated that improving positive outcomes for families and physicians would improve reporting.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="59"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Third, communication between CPS and providers should be improved, as our providers showed concern about inadequate feedback from CPS. Child protective services must keep medical providers informed about the progress and resolution of their investigation. We also conjecture that including some field experience with CPS during pediatric training would demystify the CPS process, improve communication, improve understanding, and, hence, improve compliance.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="60"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">These survey results must be interpreted cautiously because providers were asked to supply retrospective information. If child abuse injuries present infrequently, an encounter with abuse may stand out in a provider's memory, making it difficult to place in timed recall. Also, because a provider may spend more time in following up these children, this extensive time commitment may be remembered as more children seen with abuse than actually occurred. On the other hand, some providers may have been reluctant to disclose that they had not reported abuse despite the assurance that the information was confidential.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="61"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Because 49% of the sample (38 providers) completed their training in the past 10 years, these recently trained providers may be more comfortable reporting suspected abuse and working with CPS than are their more seasoned counterparts. However, there was no statistical significance between the reporting habits of the 2 groups.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="62"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">This study does not address how accurate providers are in identifying abuse. Providers who reported that they saw no abuse during the previous year may have failed to identify abuse in their patients.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="63"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">In conclusion, the results of this survey of primary care providers confirm a high rate of reporting abuse (95% of suspected cases) and provide further insight into the reasons for not reporting, which center on provider diagnostic uncertainty and past experience with child abuse reporting. Steps to address providers' concerns should be made through education of health care providers and improvement of CPS communication and response. Health care providers may need to improve their recognition and diagnostic skills and their desire to partner with CPS to ultimately result in better intervention, protection, and care for abused children.</p>
