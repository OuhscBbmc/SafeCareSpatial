## Creating `OklahomaCountyPopulationsByYear.csv`
1. Go to http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2011/CO-EST2011-01.html and http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2009/CO-EST2009-01.html (also see http://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/2000s/index.html).
2. Download the appropriate oklahoma files (here, I atypically preferred the Excel version).
3. Ignoring fluff, pull out the 2011 & 2010 columns from the first file & 2009-2000 from the second file. 
4. Paste them in the same Excel document and save as a CSV.
5. In Excel, change the cell formatting to remove the commas
6. In Excel, delete a bunch of column to the right of the data
7. In Notepadd++, Find&Replace the leading period and the phrase " County".  Replace them with "".
